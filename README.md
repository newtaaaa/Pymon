This project is a fan game based on the Pokémon franchise that is still in development but already includes the basic mechanics of the original games. The completion date for the project is still unknown. Furthermore,
the sprites for all of the “Pokémon” entities have not been uploaded to GitHub due to the large number of images to be loaded. If you would like to use the code from my project, I can send you a Google Drive link
to the images that you will need to add to the project in order to run main.py.
